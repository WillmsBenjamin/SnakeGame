# :snake: :cherries: Snake Game :cherries: :snake: 
A variant of the classic snake game.
Maybe I should replace the snakes' body parts with pictures of Kevin Durant, and the fruit with pictures of a cupcake? :trollface:

  * Multiple fruit types (ex. poisonous causes the snake length to shrink)
  * Option of classic (one fruit type), or new game modes
  * Option of solo play and local multiplayer
  * Option of player vs computer play :runner: :vs: :robot:
  * High-score persistence with XML :floppy_disk:

## Known Bugs:
  * The computer controlled snake sometimes makes a "wrong" turn based on the defined rules. 
      There must be a bug in the rule definition.
  * There is an issue with the high scores submission page. It is sometimes shown when it
      shouldn't be, and when this occurs, the page does not function.
